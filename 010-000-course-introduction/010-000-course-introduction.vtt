Hey everyone, and welcome to the Service Mesh with Istio course.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm Sevi KarakÃ¶se, and I'll be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I've worked as a software developer and then a team leader for many years.

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I've also done technical trainings, worked with development and infrastructure teams on DevOps transformation,

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and also designed team activities for organizations to be more adaptive to change.

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, as a cloud native engineer, I work with development teams on their legacy applications for microservices transformation and cloud modernization.

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
In this course, we will learn Istio through some lectures and many hands-on labs.

8
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We'll start from the basics of Istio and learn step-by-step with examples and hands-on labs.

9
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
By the end of this course, you will have an extensive understanding of how to configure and manage your Service Mesh with Istio.

10
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Let's look at the objectives of the course.

11
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
First, we start with an introduction to Istio.

12
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We learn about monoliths and microservices and why we need Service Mesh through example-driven lectures.

13
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We then get introduced to Istio.

14
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We learn how to install Istio and configure it.

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And we finally look at how to visualize our application and services with Kiali.

16
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We then drill into Istio concepts such as Gateways, Virtual Services, Destination Rules, subsets, Timeouts, Retries, Circuit Breaking, Fault Injection, Request Routing, A/B Testing, etc.

17
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Next, we look at the security aspects such as certificate management, authentication, and authorization.

18
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And finally, we look at observability such as viewing and collecting metrics with Prometheus and Grafana.

19
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We then look at K8s in a bit more detail.

20
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And finally, distributed tracing.

21
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I am super excited to take you through this journey, so let us begin.
