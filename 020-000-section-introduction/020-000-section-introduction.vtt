00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this section, you will be introduced to microservices and how they evolved.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
How service meshes came into the picture.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And then we will talk about Istio, one of the most popular service meshes right now.

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We will talk about how to get started with Istio by installing Istioctl utility first.

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And then installing Istio on your cluster.

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We will see how to deploy our example application in our cluster,

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
generate some traffic, and visualize it with the Kiali dashboard.

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Kiali helps in visualizing traffic in a nice user interface,

9
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so this will be helpful for us to understand how our mesh works.

10
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
At this phase of the course, we will look at a high-level overview of Kiali

11
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and learn how to install it and view the dashboard.

12
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But later on, towards the end of the course, we will dig in deeper.

13
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If you're ready, let us begin.
