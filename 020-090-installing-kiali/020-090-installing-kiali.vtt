00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.840
Now let's install Kiali on our cluster so we can visualize our service mesh.

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.200
Let's use this command to install and see all the add-ons that are provided in the samples folder.

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.799
We will talk about more of these tools in the observability chapter again.

4
00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:27.120
As you can see, Grafana has its service account and a set of config maps and deployments,

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.240
and Jaeger is also installed from the add-ons, and we will talk about it in the upcoming chapters.

6
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.480
Then there is a large group of objects that has come with Kiali installation.

7
00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:45.599
Then at the very end, you can see Prometheus also installed.

8
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.639
An important note is that these add-ons are not tuned for performance and security.

9
00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:56.240
These are meant for only demo purposes.

10
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.680
So, let's check the status of our Kiali deployment.

11
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.199
Yes, it has been rolled out successfully.

12
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.680
And let's verify if the Kiali service is running.

13
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.680
You can use this command if you need to check if Kiali is running or not.

14
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.680
On your cluster.

15
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.720
And now with this command, we can start Kiali dashboard.

16
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.680
It will start a browser and land on the overview page.

17
00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:44.800
In the address bar, you can see it is being served on the port 20001.

18
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.160
On the left menu, you can see different levels of visualizing your mesh.

19
00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:55.519
And on the top left, you can change the type of filter that you can use.

20
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.160
On the far right, you can filter your whole mesh by time intervals.

21
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.839
And next to it, you can change how often you need your data to be refreshed.

22
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.039
Now, here are all the namespaces in our service mesh.

23
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.360
You should be able to see all that.

24
00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:19.279
When you click this number next to the applications,

25
00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:24.000
it will take you to the applications page, which is also accessible from the left.

26
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.000
Here you will find our four applications from Bookinfo.

27
00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.960
You can always jump to some other namespace to see what's going on there.

28
00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.800
If you go to the workloads from the menu,

29
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.440
you will see all our different deployments listed as workloads.

30
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.000
Now, let's check services.

31
00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.199
There are no services, which is weird.

32
00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.839
Sometimes it takes a while to load all the Service Mesh applications and objects.

33
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.880
Yes, they are here now.

34
00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:03.520
And when we go to the Istio config menu, we will see nothing

35
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.279
because we actually don't have any Istio configurations for this name.

36
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.039
And the last bit, but a very powerful tool,

37
00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.720
is the graph menu, where we'll have most of the fun.

38
00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.679
We see this is also empty because there's no traffic right now.

39
00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:25.279
Now, let's start creating some traffic to visualize here.

40
00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:31.520
And here we have our traffic.

41
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.279
And here we have our traffic to visualize here.
