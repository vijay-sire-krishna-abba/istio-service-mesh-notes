00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.440
In this section, we will talk about some of the prerequisites you need

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.520
for fully grasping the concepts and implementing them in this course.

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.799
As a prerequisite, you must have basic Kubernetes knowledge,

4
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:28.320
such as how to deploy a basic Kubernetes cluster, basics of Pods, Replica Sets, Deployments,

5
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.120
and Services in Kubernetes.

6
00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:36.880
If you are new to Kubernetes, I would recommend starting with

7
00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:44.160
our Kubernetes for Beginners course. We will, however, recap some concepts

8
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.639
that are important to understand Service Meshes and Istio, such as Kubernetes services,

9
00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:58.400
sidecars, and Envoy proxy. If you are already familiar with these,

10
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.519
feel free to skip this section and go straight into the introduction of Istio.

11
00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:11.839
On a side note, you don't necessarily need to set up a Kubernetes cluster

12
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.599
while going through this course, as you will be using the lab environment that comes with this

13
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.959
course. However, we have some demos that will help you set up your own environment

14
00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:30.480
if you would like to try a local setup.
