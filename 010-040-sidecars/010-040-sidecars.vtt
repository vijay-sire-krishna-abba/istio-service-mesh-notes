00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000
During the course of this training, we will be mentioning Sidecars a lot,

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so let's quickly brush up on what those are.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Have you seen the small passenger cabins attached to the motorcycles?

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They're called Sidecars.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Ah, I always dreamt of traveling inside one of them when I was a kid.

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In the Kubernetes world, we know containers are encapsulated into Pods.

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Each pod can have one or more containers.

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The additional containers that support the main container

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
are called sidecars or sidecar containers.

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
They share the same volume and network,

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but they have different responsibilities.

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Sidecars are responsible for log shipping, monitoring,

13
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
file loading, or in our case, proxying,

14
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and they're relatively small in size.

15
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Our main container handles the business logic,

16
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
a functionality that adds value to our application.

17
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Sidecars help in isolating these functionalities from our business logic.

18
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Here's a sample pod definition file for a sidecar container.

19
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Under containers section, first we have an Nginx container,

20
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which uses the Nginx image.

21
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Then we have a second container,

22
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
created with a Fluentd image,

23
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
which is our sidecar container

24
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
responsible for shipping logs of the main application to a central server.

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So, that's a sidecar container.

26
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Next, we will talk about Envoy.
