00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.520
In this lecture, we will talk about Kiali.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.400
Once you have many microservices, it is important to observe them

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.480
and check them to make sure they are available as you configured them.

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.240
Kiali is a very common and powerful add-on used with Istio.

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.520
It has a web-based graphical interface.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.400
It is a very helpful and fun tool for visualizing and managing the service mesh.

7
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.840
For now, we will go over a high-level overview

8
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.959
as it will help us visualize everything we will learn in the initial chapters.

9
00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:48.560
Later on, we will go into details of Kiali in the Observability chapter.

10
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:57.680
Kiali is used for observing connections and microservices of Istio service mesh

11
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.520
and also for defining and validating them.

12
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.639
It visualizes the service mesh topology

13
00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:11.839
and provides visibility into features like request routing,

14
00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:16.559
circuit breaking, request rates, latency, and more.

15
00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:21.599
Kiali also offers wizards to apply common traffic patterns

16
00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:25.199
and automatically generates Istio configuration.

17
00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:32.080
After we install Kiali, we will also generate some test traffic

18
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.440
to make sure we can see it on the Kiali dashboard.

19
00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:42.959
Let's dive in and see how to install the add-on and view the Kiali dashboard.
