00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, we'll have a look at Istio, how it works, its architecture, and its core components.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Istio is a free and open-source service mesh that provides an efficient way to secure, connect, and monitor services.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Istio works with Kubernetes and traditional workloads, thereby bringing universal traffic management, telemetry, and security to complex deployments.

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Istio is supported and implemented by leading cloud providers and consultants.

5
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Earlier, we talked about a proxy service that takes care of all the tasks that should be outsourced from the microservices.

6
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
These proxies and the communication between them form the data plane.

7
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Istio implements these proxies using an open-source high-performance proxy known as Envoy.

8
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The proxies talk to a server-side component known as the control plane.

9
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's look at these in a bit more detail.

10
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Originally, the control plane consisted of three components, named Citadel, Pilot, and Galley.

11
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Citadel managed certificate generation, Pilot helped with service discovery, and Galley helped in validating configuration files.

12
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The three components were later combined into a single daemon called Istiod.

13
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Each service, or pod, has a separate component in it, along with the Envoy proxy called the Istio agent.

14
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The Istio agent is responsible for passing configuration secrets to the Envoy proxies.

15
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So, that's a high-level overview of Istio.

16
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Next, we will get started with Istio by installing it, and later we will dig deeper into Istio's features and functionalities.
