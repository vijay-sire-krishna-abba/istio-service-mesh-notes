00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So, in this demo, we'll be installing Istio on our cluster using istioctl.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For this, let's use istioctl install command.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
As we have talked earlier, for demo purposes, we'll use demo profile.

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's run this command now.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Once installed, let's use the verify install command to check if everything is installed

6
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
without any problems.

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
As you can see, now in our cluster there are a bunch of new resources that Istio has added.

8
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Some of these are cluster roles, cluster role bindings, custom resource definitions,

9
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and three Istio deployments with 13 custom definitions.

10
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Our Istio cluster is installed and verified successfully.

11
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Let's move on to the next section.
