00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, it's time to install Istio on our cluster.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There are three different approaches to install Istio.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We could install it using the command-line utility Istioctl.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We could use an Istio operator to install it.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Or, we could use a Helm package for the same installation.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
For this training, we will use Istioctl for installing Istio on our cluster.

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
To install Istio using Istioctl, run the Istioctl install command and specify a profile.

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For this installation, we will use a demo profile.

9
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There are also different profiles for production and performance testing.

10
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We will not use them in our training, but it's important to know that different environments need different profiles.

11
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
When this command is run, Istio is deployed in the cluster in the form of a deployment named Istiod,

12
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
in a new namespace known as the Istio system namespace.

13
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Istiod, as we discussed earlier, has different components inside it, such as Citadel, Pilot, and Galley.

14
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Along with these, it also deploys two other services known as the Istio Egress Gateway and Istio Ingress Gateway,

15
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and a bunch of Kubernetes service objects to expose these services within the cluster.

16
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We will talk more about these Gateways when we talk about Gateways in a later section.

17
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Once installed, run the Istioctl verify-install command to verify the installation.

18
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You'll see a huge list of items here.

19
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
As we talked about earlier, Istio extends Kubernetes, so you can see CRDs here.

20
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Let's now see this in action in the upcoming demo.
